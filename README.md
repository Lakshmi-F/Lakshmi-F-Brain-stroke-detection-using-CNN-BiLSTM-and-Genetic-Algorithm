# Lakshmi-F-Brain-stroke-detection-using-CNN-BiLSTM-and-Genetic-Algorithm

This project consists of - A pretrained CNN model InceptionV3 to extract relevant features, A Genetic Algorithm to select best performing features and BiLSTM model which is trained using the selected features.

This project is inspired from an IEEE published journal paper- M. A. Saleem et al., "Innovations in Stroke Identification: A Machine Learning-Based Diagnostic Model Using Neuroimages," in IEEE Access, vol. 12, pp. 35754-35764, 2024, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369673.

The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/afridirahman/brain-stroke-ct-image-dataset

We have also added a Gradio interface where the user can upload a CT image and obtain prediction.
